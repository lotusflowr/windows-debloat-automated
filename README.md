A fully automated PowerShell toolkit to **debloat**, **optimize**, and **harden Windows** — from install to ready-to-use.

This suite is purpose-built for Autounattend.xml deployments and post-install automation.  
All scripts are compatible with tools like [schneegans.de](https://schneegans.de/windows/unattend-generator) for lightweight, one-time execution during OOBE or after first login.

### 📦 Autounattend Integration

This project includes and supports a fully configured `Autounattend.xml` for hands-free deployment.

You can use [schneegans.de's Unattended Generator](https://schneegans.de/windows/unattend-generator/) to modify or inspect the unattended configuration.

To apply this to your install media, simply place the provided [`Autounattend.xml`](./autounattend.xml) at the root of a bootable Windows ISO or USB

You can find a copy of the example [`Autounattend.xml`](./autounattend.xml) in this repository.
